This repo is about applying the Koopman Operator to different Nerual Network training methods.

## EDMD
datafold module was used for the EDMD module. \
The recreation of the results can be done in edmd_neural_networks.ipynb. \

## Plots
There is a edmd_graphs.ipynb which takes the EDMD results and creates some graphs used in our paper.

## Trial and Error
A notebook of our many trial and errors is found in out/trial_error.ipynb
